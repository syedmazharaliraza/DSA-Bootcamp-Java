The JDK contains a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a few other resources such as an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc) etc. to complete the development of a Java Application.
javadoc:	The documentation generator, which automatically generates documentation from source code comments
java:	The loader for Java applications. This tool is an interpreter and can interpret the class files generated by the javac compiler. Now a single launcher is used for both development and deployment.
Other tools for development of java code.
